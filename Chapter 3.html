<h2>Chapter 3 :</h2>
<h1>First Day in Institute Technology of Blanchardstown</h1>
<p>My first lesson in ITB was started on 15th of September 2016. I visited the</p> 
<p>college and my supervisor during a day before my first lecturer class. The </p>
<p>course advisor took me for a short walk and some minor orientation inside the </p>
<p>college. I felt that this college is suitable to me because I am a sports lover </p>
<p>and there are many great sport's facilities in this college such as a standard </p>
<p>football field, badminton court, gym, basketball court and etc. When I see all </p>
<p>the sport facilities, I felt exciting and just can't wait to use them. The next </p>
<p>day is my first lecturer class in ITB. When I arrived to the college, I referred </p>
<p>to the board and check the meeting location for Computing student. The meeting </p>
<p>location was in LT1, along the way to LT1 I meet a new friend and his name is </p>
<p>David. David is also my member of Major Group Project. After we been through a </p>
<p>conversation with David, the lecturer entered the class and we started to </p>
<p>concentrate our study. Upon of that, I also made some new friends in the class </p>
<p>as well and I found that it is a good way to improve my English as well. On the </p>
<p>hand, I feel satisfy about the foods in the ITB canteen. They serve Irish food </p>
<p>and some bakery too. Eventually, I feel satisfy for my study life in ITB. I hope </p>
<p>everything is going well and completing all the modules by this year.</p>
