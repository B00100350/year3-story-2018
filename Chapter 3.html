<h2>Chapter 3 :</h2>
<h1>First Day in Institute Technology of Blanchardstown</h1>

<p>My first lesson in ITB was started on 15th of September 2016. I visited the</p> 
<p>college's environment and my supervisor during that day before starting my first </p>
<p>lecturer class. The course advisor took me for a short walk as a minor orientation </p>
<p>along college. I felt that this college has impressed me because I am a sports lover </p>
<p>and there are many cool sport's facilities in this college such as a FIFA standard </p>
<p>football field, badminton court, gym, basketball court and etc. When I see all </p>
<p>the sport facilities, I felt exciting and just can't wait to use them. The next </p>
<p>day is my first lecturer class in ITB. When I arrived to the college, I referred </p>
<p>to the board and check the meeting location for Computing student. The meeting </p>
<p>location was in LT1, along the way to LT1 I meet a new friend and his name is </p>
<p>David. David is also my team member of Major Group Project. We have a nice </p>
<p>conversation during our first meet. No longer the lecturer entered the class </p>
<p>and we started to concentrate our lesson. Upon of that, I also made some new </p>
<p>friends in the class as well and I found that it is a good way to improve my </p> 
<p>English particularly in the Irish way. On the other hand, I feel satisfy about the </p>
<p>foods that serves in the ITB canteen. They serve Irish food and some bakery too. </p>
<p>The menu is keep on changing everyday whereby I could have the opportunity to </p>
<p>taste more Irish food being a food lover like me. As a result, I feel satisfy</p>
<p> for my study life in ITB. I hope verything is going well in term of my study </p>
<p>and most importantly is completing all the modules and get graduate in time.</p>
