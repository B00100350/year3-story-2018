Along The Way Of Beginning For My Studied In Ireland

My name is Sean. I completed my Diploma study in the year of 2013. I came from a poor family therefore 
I choose to get a job instead of continuing my study. At the beginning of my career, I was just a fresh
newbie. I did not know much about anything regarding to computing knowledge. In this case, I took note 
of everything while my senior or my supervisor in the organization who keeps on teaching me everything 
about the computing knowledge. The company required me to be a fast learner therefore I must learn 
everything and understand well in a short period of time. This is because the company management wanted 
to arrange me on shift very soon due to sort of onsite engineer during that period. During the first year 
in the organization, I was supporting Seagate project. Those day people called it as Xyratex project. I 
started to learn everything as soon as possible because my manager was about to arrange me on shift work.
During the second year of my career, I been arranged to support Cisco project. Upon of that, I have learnt 
many stuffs regarding of the manufacturing of Cisco products and even some troubleshooting skills for the 
Cisco Software. During the third year, I been arranged to support more projects such as Dyson, Honneywell, 
Avago, Ericson and many others. My boss wanted to promote my position but it is because I was only a Diploma 
cert holder therefore he cant make it for me. Despite of being a Diploma cert holder, I tried very hard to 
search for a Bachelor Degree programme however every programme are required to study at least 3 years. I 
refuse to study that because I didn't want to waste so much time in the college. Yet, if I study the 3 years 
programme, I don't have the financial support for living. One day I met an educational agent who in charge 
of all Universities in Ireland. His name is CK. He told me about I only need 1 year to achieve my Bachelor 
Degree. Eventually I choose this way because I dont want to spend much time in my study. Finally this is why 
I am current locating in Ireland for my Bachelor Study. I reached Dublin on the 5th of September 2016 and I 
hope everything is gonna be fine for my study.
