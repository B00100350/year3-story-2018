<h1>Along The Way Of Beginning For My Studied In Ireland</h1>

<p>My name is Sean. I completed my Studied of Diploma in Information Technology in year 2013. I came from a</p>
<p>poor family therefore I choose to get a job directly without continuing my further study in order to support</p> 
<p>my daily expenditure. At the beginning of my career, I was just a fresh newbie in a company names Flex.</p>
<p>I was lack of knowledge in the field of computing during that period of time. In this case, I took note </p>
<p>of everything and every moment while my senior in the organization who were keep on teaching me everything </p>
<p>about the computing knowledge. The company expected me to being a fast learner therefore I must learn </p>
<p>everything and understand well in a short period of time. This is because the company management wanted</p> 
<p>to arrange me to work on shift very soon due to the short of onsite engineer in that moment. During my first year </p>
<p>in the organization, I was supporting Seagate project. Those day people were calling it as Xyratex project. I </p>
<p>started to learn everything as soon as possible because my manager was about to arrange me on shift work.</p>
<p>During the second year of my career, I been arranged to support Cisco project. Upon of that, I have learnt </p>
<p>much knowledge regarding to the manufacturing of Cisco products and even some troubleshooting skills for the </p>
<p>Cisco Software. During the third year, I been arranged to support more projects such as Dyson, Honneywell, </p>
<p>Avago, Ericson and many others. My boss wanted to promote me to a higher position however it failed because I </p>
<p>was only a Diploma certificate holder. Despite of being a Diploma certificate holder, I tried very hard to </p>
<p>search for a Bachelor Degree programme however every programme are required to study at least 3 years of time. I </p>
<p>refused to study that because I didn't want to waste so much time in the college. Yet, if I study the 3 years </p>
<p>programme, I don't have the financial support for living. One day I met an educational agent who in charge </p>
<p>of all Universities in Ireland. His name is CK. He told me about I only need 1 year to achieve my Bachelor </p>
<p>Degree. Eventually I choose this way because I dont want to spend much time in my study. Finally this is why </p>
<p>I am current locating in Ireland for my Bachelor Study. I reached Dublin on the 5th of September 2016 and I </p>
<p>hope everything is gonna be fine for my study.</p>
