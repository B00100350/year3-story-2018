<h1>Living In Ireland</h1>

<p>I reached Ireland on the 5th of September 2016 and this is also my first time come over into this country.</p>
<p>When I arrived into the airport, there were someone who sent by ITB who picked me up from the airport. That guy</p>
<p>sent me to the college's accommodation. When I reached to the accommodation, I settled down everything before going</p>
<p>out for exploring the city. My first accommodation in Ireland was in Sycamore BnB which is in Old Cabra Road. I met</p>
<p>my first friend in Ireland in Sycamore.That guy was staying with me in Sycamore. His name is Kunal from India and he</p> 
<p>is also a student from ITB who studying Engineering. These days, Kunal was taking me to explore the Dublin city and</p> 
<p>showed me some introduction about using the infrastructure in the city. After a few days of staying in Old Cabra Road,</p> 
<p>I finally moved into my exact accommodation in Blanchardstown which is where am I currently staying. I am staying with</p> 
<p>an Irish family. My landlord is a very good person, she treat us very well. Somehow she even cooked us some Irish</p> 
<p>traditional foods. The college isnt very far from my accommodation therefore I used to walk everyday to the college.</p> 
<p>There are few stuffs that I need time to used to it in Ireland which is the foods and weather. Despite I have been </p>
<p>used to the foods in Malaysia and it is all day long in the summer day in Malaysia. I felt freezing in the beginning </p>
<p>and I felt unsual of eating Irish food. In term of improving my Irish English, I tried to start up a conversation with</p>
<p>many Irish lads and it definately takes time for me to understand what are they trying to say. In consequence, I prefer</p> 
<p>the life in Ireland and I hope I could get a job over here after I finished the study programme in ITB.</p>
