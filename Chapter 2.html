<h2>Chapter 2 :</h2>
<h1>Living In Ireland</h1>

<p>I reached Ireland on the 5th of September 2016 and this is also my first time to step into this country. When I arrived</p>
<p> into the airport, a staff of ITB who picked me up from the airport. We have a nice conversation along the journey while </p>
<p>he was fetching me to the college's accommodation. When I reached to the accommodation, I settled down everything before going</p>
<p>out for exploring the city. My first accommodation in Ireland was in Sycamore BnB which is in Old Cabra Road. I met</p>
<p>my first friend in Ireland in Sycamore.That guy was staying with me in Sycamore. His name is Kunal from India and he</p> 
<p>is also a student from ITB who studying Engineering. Kunal was accompanying me to explore the Dublin city during those few days</p> 
<p>and showed me some basic introductions about using the infrastructure in the city. After a few days of staying in Old Cabra Road,</p> 
<p>I finally moved into my exact accommodation in Blanchardstown which is where I am currently staying. I am staying with</p> 
<p>an Irish family. My landlord is a very kind person, she treat us very well. She even cooked us some Irish traditional foods</p> 
<p>for us occasionally. The college isnt too far from my accommodation therefore I used to walk everyday to the college.</p> 
<p>There are few stuffs that I need time to get used to in Ireland which is the foods and weather. Despite I have been </p>
<p>used to the foods in Malaysia and it is all day long in the summer day in Malaysia. I feel freezing in the beginning </p>
<p>and not getting used to the Irish local food. In term of improving my Irish English, I tried to start up a conversation with</p>
<p>many Irish lads and it definately takes time for me to understand what are they trying to say in particularly they have their</p>
<p>Irish accent. In consequence, I prefer the life in Ireland and I hope I could get a job over here after I finished the study programme</p>
<p>in ITB.</p>
