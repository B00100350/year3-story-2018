I reached Ireland on the 5th of September 2016 and this is also my first time come over into this country. 
When I arrived into the airport, there were someone who sent by ITB who picked me up from the airport. That guy 
sent me to the college's accommodation. When I reached to the accommodation, I settled down everything before going 
out for exploring the city. My first accommodation in Ireland was in Sycamore BnB which is in Old Cabra Road. I met 
my first friend in Ireland in Sycamore.That guy was staying with me in Sycamore. His name is Kunal from India and he 
is also a student from ITB who studying Engineering. These days, Kunal was taking me to explore the Dublin city and 
showed me some introduction about using the infrastructure in the city. After a few days of staying in Old Cabra Road, 
I finally moved into my exact accommodation in Blanchardstown which is where am I currently staying. I am staying with 
an Irish family. My landlord is a very good person, she treat us very well. Somehow she even cooked us some Irish 
traditional foods. The college isnt very far from my accommodation therefore I used to walk everyday to the college. 
There are few stuffs that I need time to used to it in Ireland which is the foods and weather. Despite I have been 
used to the foods in Malaysia and it is all day long in the summer day in Malaysia. I felt freezing in the beginning 
and I felt unsual of eating Irish food. In term of improving my Irish English, I tried to start up a conversation with
 many Irish lads and it definately takes time for me to understand what are they trying to say. In consequence, I prefer 
 the life in Ireland and I hope I could get a job over here after I finished the study programme in ITB.
